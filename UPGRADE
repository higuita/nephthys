== Upgrading to 1.2 ==

 * The "images" directory has been moved from the main directory into
   the default theme directory (/themes/default). All templates have
   been updated so they reference images & icons on the right place
   now. If you have made your own theme, you need to followup with
   these changes otherwise your template will reference not more
   existing images.

 * With introducing the new multi-language system all language specific
   text has been moved to language-files (.lang) in the "lang" directory
   within the default theme directory (/themes/default). Templates now
   only contain "keywords" which will be looked up when parsing the
   Smarty templates and replaced with the text of the choosen language.
   If you have made your own theme, you need to followup and replace
   the text within with the language keywords - otherwise you will earn
   many failure messages. Also you need to copy the lang-directory from
   the default theme to your own theme.
