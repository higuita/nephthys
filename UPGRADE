== Upgrading to 1.5 ==

 * MySQL interface has changed to mysqli.
   See http://oss.netshadow.at/wiki/nephthys/ChangingToMySqli for more.

 * The directory for the location of the template engine cache
   directories is now configureable via the $tmpl_path variable.
   If this one has not been set in nephthys_cfg.php, it defaults
   to $base_path. So this should not require any change when you do
   a upgrade from a previous version. Just to let you know.

== Upgrading to 1.4 ==

 * Nothing special needs to be done.

== Upgrading to 1.3 ==

 * Nothing special needs to be done.

== Upgrading to 1.2 ==

 * The "images" directory has been moved from the main directory into
   the default theme directory (/themes/default). All templates have
   been updated so they reference images & icons on the right place
   now. If you have made your own theme, you need to followup with
   these changes otherwise your template will reference not more
   existing images.

 * With introducing the new multi-language system all language specific
   text has been moved to language-files (.lang) in the "lang" directory
   within the default theme directory (/themes/default). Templates now
   only contain "keywords" which will be looked up when parsing the
   Smarty templates and replaced with the text of the choosen language.
   If you have made your own theme, you need to followup and replace
   the text within with the language keywords - otherwise you will earn
   many failure messages. Also you need to copy the lang-directory from
   the default theme to your own theme.

== Upgrading to 1.1 ==

 * Nothing special needs to be done.

== Upgrading to 1.0 ==

 * This is the inital version? From what do you plan to upgrade?
